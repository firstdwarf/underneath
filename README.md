This is a Minecraft Forge mod for Minecraft version 1.12.2 called "underneath". This mod is designed to provide the player with a relatively controlled yet content-rich exploration and progression experience.

The fundamental premise borrows from the Jules Verne novel "Journey to the Center of the Earth." By entering a volcano found in a rare surface biome, the player can travel to a world below the overworld- underneath bedrock. This new dimension, and any that they may encounter further down, are wildly different from vanilla worlds.

These dimensions are generated using an all-new system designed to create radiating networks of tunnels with points of interest called "nodes" at random locations on the network. No tunnel ends without reaching another node and all tunnels can be traversed without breaking a single block.

This feature is crucial, as tools, armor, blocks, and more added by other mods or the base game will be of little use so far below the surface. It is my hope that the player has countless reasons to keep exploring and progressing and encounters surprises around every corner. At the time you read this note, odds are, this mod is feature-ready but nowhere near feature complete.
